# __Rockanrolla Band Website - Testing__

After following all the sessions at Code Institute about UX and reading a lot of information in different platforms about UX Design and testing, I found some links and e-books rich on UX contents that helped me to decide the way to design and run tests on this project. Despite I am a newbie and design is a new whole world to me, I got engaged to one of these platforms and, since then, every time I have some spare minutes I try to enrich my knowledgement reading their books and articles. I relate some of the links I used for this below: 

[Studio by UXPin, Free UX Design Resources](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/)

[Guide to Usability testing](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/ebooks/guide-to-usability-testing/)

[22 Essential Tools for Testing Your Website's Usability](https://mashable.com/2011/09/30/website-usability-tools/?europe=true)

I have divided this document in two sections with different testing methods inside

+ __*Manual testing methods:*__ These are the testing methods I have used. First locally (simulating me as a visitor) on all the site pages and Then requesting help from some colleagues to navigate through the site. Their help has been so valuable as explained on the briefings:
    - Local testing.
    - Colleagues/Friends testing.

+ __*Online testing methods:*__ These are the test methods I have used with different available tools online: 
    - Code Validation. 
    - Readability.

## __Manual testing methods:__

### __*Local testing:*__

To run this tests I have used three different browsers(Chrome v73, Mozilla v66, Opera v58) under Windows 7 in a laptop. The features were tested first using developers tools to check the behaviour under Responsive Design and going through all Media Queries breakpoints defined. Then, I hve run the site under a normal browser as a in full size and also resizing its window.   

+ Header:

  - Band Logo:

    1. Clicked over it on all pages and linked correctly to Home page (index.html) every time. When checking Media Queries on small devices this worked in the same way as expected.

  - Navigation menu:
    1. Checked the 'burguer menu' on small devices in every page and bars color changed as expected when button was clicked. Then checked that menu toggled from hidden position on the left to the right, making visible the navigation items and links as expected. About the transitions, when checking on small devices, they couldn't apply because hover doesn't make any changes. Only when clicking on them the change expected could be noticed. About the links, I clicked on everyone of them and no one was broken, allowing me to navigate between pages as expected.
    2. Checked the navigation menu on bigger devices, hovering over all navigation items to check that the background color and the text color changed. Also checked the transition time applied correctly. This worked fine and as expected. Also I checked again that all links were working properly as expected.
    3. Checked responsiveness rotating the screen to change the size of it. All the navigation items elements moved from being displayed in column in small devices, to being displayed in line in bigger screens as expected. No overflow was noticed.
    
+ Section:
    Checked responsiveness rotating the screen to change the size of it and the two columns with their contents moved from being displayed in column in small devices, to being displayed side by side in bigger screens as expected. Their contents occupied the space available as expected. One thing to note about the column on the right is that there is still space available to display more information about the band in some of the pages. This should be a chance of future improvement for the site.

    - Titles:
        - Checked the sizes of the column titles. This was working wrongly and interfiering with the Responsive design until I learnt how to adjust progresevely the font-size for different screen sizes.
        
    - Carrousels:
        - Checked the behaviour of the carrousels in different screen sizes and no error or overflow was detected. Images and transitions were applied correctly. Contents adjusted thier size with responsiveness when rotating the screen.
    
    -Articles:
    -Forms:

+ Footer:

  


Hover over the "request quote" button and verify the hover colour change works as expected.
Click on the "request quote" button and verify that it links to the contact page.
Change screen size to small and click burger icon, verify that the menu drops down and that the menu text is centred.
Repeat verification of functionality and responsiveness on my mobile phone and tablet.
Hero image / video:

Go to "Home" page from a desktop.
Confirm video is visible, autoplays on mute and is 100% width of the screen.
Reduce the width of the window to confirm that the video switches to static image in mobile.
Reduce and expand width of window to confirm that the overlay on top of image / video responds correctly and does not obscure important features.
Compelling copy section:

Reduce and expand width of window to confirm that the text in this section responds correctly and looks good on all device widths.
Testimonials:

Reduce and expand width of window to confirm that 3 testimonials display on medium to large screens, but one is hidden on mobile devices.
Call to action button:

Hover over call to action button and verify the hover colour change.
Click the call to action button and verify that it links to the correct page.
Footer:

Hover over each social media icon and confirm colour and size transitions expected.
Click on each icon to confirm it opens a separate tab for it's link.
Reduce and expand width of window to verify that the footer is responsive and looks good on all device widths.
Review all functionality and responsiveness on my mobile phone and tablet.
