# __Rockanrolla Band Website - Testing__

After following all the sessions at Code Institute about UX and reading a lot of information in different platforms about UX Design and testing, I found some links and e-books rich on UX contents that helped me to decide the way to design and run tests on this project. Despite I am a newbie and design is a new whole world to me, I got engaged to one of these platforms and, since then, every time I have some spare minutes I try to enrich my knowledgement reading their books and articles. I relate some of the links I used for this below: 

[Studio by UXPin, Free UX Design Resources](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/)

[Guide to Usability testing](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/ebooks/guide-to-usability-testing/)

[22 Essential Tools for Testing Your Website's Usability](https://mashable.com/2011/09/30/website-usability-tools/?europe=true)

I have divided this document in two sections with different testing methods inside

+ __*Manual testing methods:*__ These are the tests I have run locally (simulating me as a visitor) on all the site pages and also requesting help from some colleagues to navigate through the site. Their help has been so valuable as explained on the briefings. So two testing methods came out of this:
    - Personal testing.
    - Colleagues testing.

+ __*Online testing methods:*__ These are the test I run using different available tools online. So XXX testing methods came out of this
    - Code Validation. 
    - Readability.
