# Rockanrolla Project


## What is this?

This is a my very first Milestone Project. As the final step of the User Centric Front End Development Module,
this project should give me the chance to show all the learnings acquired after going through the first three modules
included in the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Course.

The overall project consists of creating a website for a 1960's Rock band, showing their music and publicizing
their availability and future events. Project brief and guidelines can be reviewed in this [portable document file](https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla/blob/master/project_docs/Project%20Brief%20and%20Guidelines.pdf "Project Brief and Guidelines").


## How does it work?

This project works over 6 Html pages styled using Bootstrap libraries and customized CSS properties. 
Folder projects_docs contain the previous wireframes to design the site and make it full responsive.

## Why a rock band site?

The motivation behind this project is not only about following the briefing and guidelines but also
to achieve something that I never did before. Creating a site like that, whith such content, should 
give me the experience to be able to accept any other kind of customize project.
