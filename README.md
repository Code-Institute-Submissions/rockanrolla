<!-- ## How does it work?

This project works over 6 Html pages styled using Flexbox and customized CSS properties. 
Folder projects_docs contain the previous wireframes to design the site and make it full responsive. -->

<!-- ## Why a rock band site?

The motivation behind this project is not only about following the briefing and guidelines but also
to achieve something that I never did before. Creating a site like that, whith such content, should 
give me the experience to be able to accept any other kind of customized project. -->

                        <h4>This is my very first Website Project. </h4>                        
                        <h5>It is based on all the learnings acquired through the initial three modules or the Fullstack Web Developer (Code Institute).</h5>                        
                        <h5>It is about an imaginary rock band from California from the 70's and the user can review their albums, past and future events and videoclips. It also allows the user to keep in contact with the band providing their feedback via mail and, if interested, buy event tickets or hire the band for private events.</h5>                        
                        <h5>This site is simulating all the previous features and all its content is pure fiction. Everything has been researched and collected from many different sites around the WWW.</h5>
