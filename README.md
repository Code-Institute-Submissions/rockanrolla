<!-- ## Why a rock band site?

The motivation behind this project is not only about following the briefing and guidelines but also
to achieve something that I never did before. Creating a site like that, whith such content, should 
give me the experience to be able to accept any other kind of customized project. -->


# Rockanrolla Band Website

*__This is my very first Website Project.__*

It is based on all the learnings acquired through the initial three modules or the Fullstack Web Developer (Code Institute).

It is about an imaginary rock band from California from the 70's and the user can review their albums, past and future events and videoclips. It also allows the user to keep in contact with the band providing their feedback via mail and, if interested, buy event tickets or hire the band for private events.

This site is simulating all the previous features and all its content is pure fiction. Everything has been researched and collected from many different sites around the WWW.

* Many other music bands overload the sites with sponsors. That takes visitor's attention to different things. On this site, the band is the main sponsor
* Some past events are included and displayed in a time line. This should encourage visitors to update their experiences when attending to a concert not displayed on site.
